                // Once upon a time, a Canadian girl decided to go on an exchange during her last year of university to
                // a school in Singapore: SUTD. Unbeknownst to her, a Belgian boy had also decided to go on Erasmus to
                // the same school at the same time. What began as a group dinner between many friends, turned into a more
                // private swim at the outdoor pool, and into an even more private conversation at a Rec Room. What would
                // have already been an amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience, became even more meaningful because of the 
                // unexpected connection that had been formed. This Valentine's day is one month shy of a 1.5 year anniversary
                // between 2 people who would never have expected to find love in a new country and go through the ups and
                // downs of life together.
